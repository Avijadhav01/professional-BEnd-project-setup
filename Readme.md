// ===============================================
// ðŸ“Œ Learning Note - Chai aur Backend Series
// Today I learned about how to handle file uploads
// using Multer (for receiving files from users)
// and Cloudinary (for storing files in the cloud).
//
// ðŸ”¹ Multer: Helps us accept files from the client
// (e.g., images, videos, docs) and
// temporarily store them on the server.
//
// ðŸ”¹ Cloudinary: A cloud service where we upload
// the files received by Multer.
// It provides a public URL that
// can be stored in the database
// and used later in the app.
//
// We created a cloudinary.js utility file that
// configures Cloudinary and helps us upload files
// directly from our backend.
